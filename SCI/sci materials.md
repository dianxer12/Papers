## Discussion
With rapid development of Internet technology, SM becomes an important source of health information.(St Louis, C. and Zorlu, G. Can Twitter predict disease outbreaks?. BMJ. 2012; 344: e2353)

---
## Limitations and conclusion
1. SM provides a convenient way for patients to access health information and interact with medical practitioners, it needs the support of Internet or smartphone, which limits the unrestricted use of this method in public, especially in developing countries and areas. 
2. Second, we chose Wechat as the SM platform to deliver preparation-related information because it is the most widely used mobile app that provides SM service in China. On the basis of the findings in this study, there is a good possibility that with appropriate content, other SM tools, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, may also be helpful to promote the quality of bowel preparation.
